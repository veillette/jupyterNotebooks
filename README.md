# Jupyter Notebooks for Physics Education

## 📚 Overview

Welcome to my collection of Jupyter notebooks designed specifically for physics education! This repository contains a wide range of interactive materials that can be used for teaching and learning various physics concepts, from introductory mechanics to advanced electromagnetism.

Whether you're a student seeking to strengthen your understanding, an educator looking for teaching resources, or simply a physics enthusiast, these notebooks offer hands-on experiences with physics concepts through code.

## 🧪 Content Areas

The repository is organized into several major physics domains:

### 📘 Classical Mechanics
- Numerical integration techniques
- Projectile motion simulations
- Hard sphere gas models
- Solutions to differential equations

### ⚡ Electromagnetism
- Cyclotron motion visualization
- Kirchhoff's laws implementation
- Biot-Savart law demonstrations

### 🌡️ Thermal Physics
- Hard sphere gas simulations
- Statistical mechanics demonstrations

### 🔭 Optics
- Complex numbers in wave physics
- Polarization demonstrations

## 💻 Getting Started

### Using Google Colab
Most notebooks include a "Open in Colab" button that allows you to run them directly in Google Colab without any local setup.

## 🔧 Features
