### Instructor: Martin Veillette

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, and much more.

This semester we will learn how to use Jupyter to perfrom data acquisition, data processing as well as modeling and analysis of our experiments.
