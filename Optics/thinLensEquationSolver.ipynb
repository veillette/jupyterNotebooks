        "# Geometric Optics with Thin Lens Equations\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we'll delve into the principles behind their behavior using the thin lens equations. These equations provide a fundamental understanding of how light rays interact with lenses and mirrors, enabling us to calculate crucial parameters such as focal length, object distance, image distance, and magnification.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Geometric optics deals with the propagation of light and its interaction with optical elements such as lenses and mirrors. The thin lens equations are essential tools in understanding and analyzing the behavior of lenses. These equations relate the focal length (f), object distance (d_o), and image distance (d_i) for a lens. Additionally, we'll explore the concept of\n",
        "lateral magnification, which describes how much larger or smaller an image appears relative to the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Functions Included\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we've provided Python functions to help you perform calculations related to thin lens equations and magnification:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Thin Lens Equation Solver**: This function allows you to solve for the focal length (f), object distance (d_o), or image distance (d_i) given the other two parameters using the thin lens equation.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Magnification Calculator**: Use this function to calculate the magnification of a lens based on the object distance (d_o) and the image distance (d_i).\n",
        "\n",
        "## How to Use\n",
        "\n",
        "To use the provided functions, simply call them with the required parameters. You can input known values such as focal length, object distance, or image distance, and the functions will compute the desired output. Feel free to experiment with different values to gain insights into the behavior of lenses and the resulting images they produce.\n"
